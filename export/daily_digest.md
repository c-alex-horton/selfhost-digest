WASHINGTON (AP) — [House Republicans](https://apnews.com/article/trump-big-bill-tax-cuts-medicaid-1c893945b416419d806dacb6d24b895a) added a provision to their sweeping tax cut package authorizing sales of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in Nevada and Utah, prompting outrage from Democrats and environmentalists who called it a betrayal that could lead to drilling, mining and logging in sensitive areas.

Elon Musk’s so-called [Department of Government Efficiency](https://www.wired.com/story/doge-recruiter-ai-agents-palantir-clown-emoji/) (DOGE) has started rolling out digital infrastructure for a new golden visa immigration program, according to sources familiar with the matter, public records, and tests conducted by WIRED. The White House has yet to formally announce the initiative, but some US permanent residents and foreign visitors are already being asked if they have applied for a “Trump Card Visa.”

The company announced today that developers can now enable Claude to [access current web information through its API](https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search-api), allowing the AI assistant to conduct multiple progressive searches to compile comprehensive answers complete with source citations. The move comes as web search undergoes its most significant transformation since Google revolutionized the field more than two decades ago.

> Recently came across this magazine from the Linux Format on a second hand vintage shop and obviously had to go for it! These magazines are still produced these to this day btw. However, when I went to linuxformat.com after receiving my magazine to check out some of their other ones, I saw that they were in fact just celebrating their 25-year anniversary and have put out a digital version of the very magazine I bought - for everyone to view digitally!  
> 
> **Their announcement**:
> > 25-years ago in this month of May, back in 2000 (just after the giant Y2K meltdown that flipped every plane upsidedown) Linux Format was first published. To help celebrate and remember this momentous pinnacle of publishing prowess (and while we still have server access) we'll be popping out a few classic issues of Linux Format in PDF format. As we already have it to hand here's issue LXF001 with a very young looking Nick Veitch. 
> 
> 
> ###### The magazine can be found digitally at: https://linuxformat.com/files/pdfs/LXF001.pdf 
> 
> 
> Either way, I had no idea of the timing but thought it was a fun experience and worthy to share here. Enjoy a step back into memory-lane!
> 
> 
> Have a great rest of your day!
